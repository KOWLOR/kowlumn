Multi column based on demand, nestable, responsive, grid-system.

To create a grid pattern define it in the <code>$cols</code> array in _variables.scss.
Then, call the <code>.base--*</code> class to use it, not only on <code>.container</code>, but also in a nested <code>.row</code> !
Obviously, you can't nest a <code>.container</code> in another one or within a <code>.row</code>, but you create a <code>.row</code> in a <code>.kl-*</code>.

That's all !
