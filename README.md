Multi column based on demand, nestable, responsive, grid-system.

To create a grid pattern define it in the $cols array in _variables.scss.
Then, call the .base--* class to use it, not only on .container, but also in a nested .row !
Obviously, you can't nest a .container in another one or within a .row, but you create a .row in a .kl-*.

That's all !
